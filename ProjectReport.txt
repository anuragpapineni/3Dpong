Game Design Modifications:
We actually didn't have to modify anything from our original game design this time, so we set scope correctly!

Issues:
The only bumps in the road we hit were establishing a connection between a server and client, and figuring out how CEGUI worked initially. After getting a connection going, sending a message back and forth was relatively easy.

Successes:
We accomplished everything we set out to achieve in the initial write-up. While the game is essentially 3D pong, we now understand how to network and set up GUI code in general, so we could pretty easily extend that knowledge to a more complex game given more time. When we hit occasional issues, it only took us an hour or two to knock them out, so it was a painless project unlike trying to integrate bullet for the first time. We believe a lot of what made the project easy to extend was properly architecting the system the first time around so changes could be made quickly.
